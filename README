This multi agent system (MAS) is allows the user to create multiple routers that 
can all communicate with each other in a full mesh network structure. It allows 
the addition of portals to each router and then agents to each of these portals. 
This MAS does not allow portal to portal connections or user agent to user agent 
directly due to the strain on these agents.
This MAS is laid out using an graphical user interface (GUI) and allows the user
to add agents portals and routers through this GUI. This MAS allows connection
across devices as well through connection to a router and when creating a portal 
asks for the IP address to connect to the router.



We had some changes we would have made to this MAS however due to time 
constraints we chose to not add these. Another reason we chose to not add them 
is due to rea;lising we can only add so much for the submission and we would add
improvements in future updates.
Improvements we would make, Time permitting:
1)
2)
3)
